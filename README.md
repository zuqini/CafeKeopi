You've spent your entire life savings on opening your caf√©...
But now you need to feed your family with your earnings.
Mix and serve your drink before your customers' patience runs out!

This was a casual game jam I did with my friend, [Ray Wan](https://github.com/raywan).

We generated a theme (Coffee) and both made separate games. check our Ray's game [here](https://github.com/raywan/my-blood-is-coffee)!

I was supposed to do it over the weekend but I procrastinated and wrote the game on and off over Monday and Tuesday instead.

This was the first time I drew my own assets - it was surprisingly fun and I learned a lot from it. I used [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), a pretty neat sprite editor.
